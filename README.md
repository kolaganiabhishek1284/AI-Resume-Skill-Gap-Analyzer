# AI Resume Skill Gap Analyzer

## Overview
This project is a simple AI-powered prototype that analyzes a fresher's resume
for Data Science roles and provides actionable feedback.

The goal is to demonstrate how prompt-based AI can simulate a recruiter or
career coach to help candidates understand missing skills and improve resumes.

## Problem Statement

what skills they are missing for job roles.

## Solution
This application takes resume text as input and returns:
- Missing technical skills
- Missing soft skills
- Resume improvement suggestions
- Resume score
- ATS optimization tip

## How AI Helps
The system uses a carefully designed Golden Prompt to guide AI-style reasoning
and generate structured feedback, simulating a real recruiter’s evaluation.
